# LightBnB Project

LightBnB is a Database / sql queries / psql based project that uses server-side javascript queries to display information about rental property options on the clients web browser! It had an intention to mimick AirBnB.

The project uses database queries to display Properies, rental options within a specified city, properties with a minimum rating of your choosing, properties within your desired price point, and properties belonging to a specific user!
